List of company teams, employees.
Project Zugrif, is the name of a project where the company builds a series of datasets to customize the knowledge of an existing AI chatbot, like Llama3, GPT4, or Gemini, with speicific information on divergent topics. Most users would have access to public IT, and HR datasets, however HR would have deeper access to more private data for their team's chatbot. This Zugrif is meant to be a company-speicific information center, that gives employees specialized chatbots to ask questions to, instead of taking up employee's times. However, each team would be responsible for adding new data to their datasets to keep people happy and not in need to seek the team's time to answer questions about projects, updates, etc..
